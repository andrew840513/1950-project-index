		<h2>Issues With the Current Design</h2>
		<ol>
		<li>Weekly contents are disorganized</li>
		<li>Difficult to search contents</li>
		<li>Poor navigation</li>
		<li>Lack of student community</li>
		<li>References are buried in the lecture notes</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		Currently, the content are organized into weekly pages. However, these pages themselves are not well organized. Students cannot quickly access the exercise and homework sub-sections. Furthermore, our team noted that some weeks' exercises have their own pages in the slide out navigation. This is inconsistent with the other lecture weeks.

		<h2>Our Team's Design</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Use a tabbed layout for each of the lecture sub pages</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Lecture</li>
					<li>Exercise</li>
					<li>Homework</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Move the navigation to the top of the page</li>
			<li>Add a student forum page</li>
			<li>Add a page for external references and resources</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The most important design change is the use of a tabbed layout for each of the weekly lectures. This allows student to quickly access the contents and avoids the "Wall of Text" usability issue. For example, students can quickly go back to the practice just the weekly exercise. This also forces the content author to fill the subsections.</p>
		<p>The current design of the page does not provide any interaction between students themselves and with the instructor. All communication are carried out via email between a student and the instructor. By adding a forum section, students can ask the instructor questions that may interest other students. The instructor can also gauge how well the students understand the lectures and only answer additional questions once instead of repeatedly.</p>
		<p>Finally, external references and resources are currently buried in the weekly lecture notes or simply mentioned during class. Student may not recall or attend all the classes and need to conduct self studies outside of class. By adding a reference / resource section, students can quickly access them instead of scrolling through pages of text.</p>
